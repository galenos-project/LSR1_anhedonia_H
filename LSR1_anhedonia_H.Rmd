# 1. Methods (brief)

In this first iteration of the living systematic review we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared pro-dopaminergic interventions to placebo in adults with unipolar depression (i.e. any standardised measure, above-threshold symptoms on any standardised measure, or a clinical diagnosis based on any operationalised criteria).

Eight databases were searched from inception up to the 9th of November, 2023 (see [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies") for full search strings).
Database search results were imported into [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914 "EPPI-Reviewer") and de-duplicated prior to screening.
All steps related to record screening and data extraction were completed in [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914 "EPPI-Reviewer").

Titles and abstracts of the identified records were screened by at least two reviewers (CF, MC, JK, JP).
We retrieved the full-texts and any supporting documents for all records that were not excluded at the title and abstract screening stage.
The full-text screening was conducted by at least two reviewers (CF, JK, JP, AK, EB).
Conflicts at title and abstract, and full-text screening, were resolved through discussion between the two reviewers and involvement of a third reviewer (AC, EGO).
Additional information on the full study eligibility criteria can be found in the pre-published [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies").

Relevant data was extracted using [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914 "EPPI-Reviewer") by at least two reviewers (CF, CA, EB, JK).

As specified in our [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies"), we focused on the following outcomes:

-   anhedonia symptom severity: using anhedonia-specific scales, anhedonia-specific sub-scales, or individual items focusing on anhedonia (observer-rated or self-rated). Continuous, primary outcome.
-   anxiety symptom severity: as per observer or self-reported standardised scales. Continuous, secondary outcome.
-   acceptability: proportion of participants dropping out for any reason. Binary, secondary outcome.
-   tolerability: the proportion of participants dropping out due to an adverse event. Binary, secondary outcome.
-   safety: the proportion of participants reporting specific adverse events (nausea, headache, insomnia, constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, vomiting). Binary, secondary outcome.

For anhedonia and anxiety symptom severity, we extracted outcome data reported at 8 weeks post-treatment or manipulation.
If the information at 8 weeks was not available, we considered eligible data ranging between 4 and 12 weeks (with preference to the time point closest to 8 weeks and, if equidistant, the longer outcome).
For acceptability, tolerability, safety and safety (specific adverse events), we extracted outcome data reported at the end of the studies.

When extracting continuous outcomes we extracted mean and standard deviation to two decimal places.
Where standard error was reported instead, we converted the value to standard deviation.
Baseline and endpoint values were extracted, where only change in score and baseline or endpoint was reported, the missing value was calculated by adding or subtracting the change score to the baseline or endpoint.

When extracting dichotomous outcomes we extracted natural numbers and where only percentages of participant groups were reported, a value was calculated and rounded up to the nearest natural number.
Adverse events were extracted using the exact terms they were reported in the included studies.

We assessed risk of bias with the RoB2 tool (Higgins et al. 2019).
All outcomes for all included studies were assessed by at least two reviewers (JK, CF, CA, AH) and conflicts were resolved by discussion between reviewers (Flemyng et al. 2023).
To evaluate biases due to missing evidence, the ROB-ME tool (Page et al. 2023) was used with the same double screening and conflict resolution process as described above.
We took into account the usable data from the eligible studies identified in the search, the comprehensiveness of the search, and potential patterns of missingness and small-study effects.
We followed the algorithm to assign a low or high risk of reporting bias, or to express some concerns, by answering signalling questions related to the domains mentioned above.

Effect sizes were calculated as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes (anhedonia and anxiety symptom severity) and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes (acceptability, tolerability, and specific-adverse events).
We calculated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the pooled effect size for each meta-analysis.

Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model with the inverse variance method, using the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for 𝞽^2^ and the Hartung-Knapp correction method to adjust 95% confidence intervals, if there are at least five studies.
Prediction intervals of the overall pooled effect were calculated to report the heterogeneity.

In terms of sensitivity analyses, we aggregated individual participant data (IPD) on the MADRS "inability to feel" item from 34 randomised controlled trials (14054 participants) on antidepressants in people with depression we had access to.
We performed the following analyses to estimate the performance of bupropion versus placebo at the primary outcome (i.e. reduction in anhedonia scores): - aggregated IPD, all antidepressants and placebo, random effects network meta-analysis.
- aggregated IPD, bupropion versus placebo, random effects pairwise meta-analysis.
- combination of aggregated IPD and early studies identified in this living systematic review for which IPD were not available, random effects pairwise meta-analysis.

Meta-regressions were planned for the following variables: mean age of participants, mean anhedonia baseline score, mean anxiety baseline score, sex (proportion of female participants), and planned treatment duration.
Meta-regressions were only conducted for outcomes where data was available from 10 or more studies.

Summary of evidence tables were constructed for all outcomes including a summary of the meta-analytic result, biases within-study, across-study, and due to indirectness.

Please refer to the [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies") and the extended data for more details.

NA = not available.

## 2.3 Description of included studies

We identified `r length(unique(df$studlab))` eligible studies.
The characteristics of the identified studies can be found in **Table 1**.
Data from `r cat(paste0(length(all.studies)))` studies contributed with at least one outcome with quantitative data (total of `r all.participants` participants), which included adults from multiple countries.
The mean age of participants was `r round(mean(df$age_mean, na.rm = T), 1)` years (range `r round(min(df$age_mean, na.rm = T), 0)` to `r round(max(df$age_mean, na.rm = T), 0)` years), with a mean proportion of `r round(mean(df$female_prop, na.rm = T), 2)` female participants (range `r round(min(df$female_prop, na.rm = T), 2)` to `r round(max(df$female_prop, na.rm = T), 2)`).
Included studies allocated the participants to treatment lasting between `r round(min(df$tx_duration, na.rm = T), 1)` to `r round(max(df$tx_duration, na.rm = T), 1)` weeks (median, `r round(median(df$tx_duration, na.rm = T), 1)` weeks).

## 2.4 Primary outcome: reduction in anhedonia scores at 8 weeks (from 4 to 12 weeks)

### 2.4.1 Pairwise meta-analysis

```{r anhedonia_forest, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}
forest(pwma.anhedonia, 
       sortvar = seTE, 
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       label.e = 'Intervention', 
       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'Anhedonia symptoms severity',
       col.square = pwma.anhedonia$data$colour,
       prediction = T
       )
```

**Figure 2.** Forest plot for symptoms of anhedonia (primary outcome) comparing pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo for individuals with anhedonia at 4-12 weeks (primary timepoint).
SMD: standardised mean difference, 95% CI: 95% confidence intervals, SD: standard deviation.

`r pwma.anhedonia$k.TE` `r ifelse(pwma.anhedonia$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')` contributed with data to the meta-analysis with a total of `r sum(c(pwma.anhedonia$n.e.pooled, pwma.anhedonia$n.c.pooled), na.rm = T)` participants (`r pwma.anhedonia$n.e.pooled` allocated to pro-dopaminergic interventions, `r pwma.anhedonia$n.c.pooled` allocated to pill placebo).

The comparative effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions versus placebo showed `r ifelse(((pwma.anhedonia$lower.random < 0) & (pwma.anhedonia$upper.random < 0)), 'an effect favouring pro-dopaminergic interventions', ifelse(((pwma.anhedonia$lower.random > 0) & (pwma.anhedonia$upper.random > 0)), 'an effect favouring placebo', 'a comparable effect not excluding the null effect'))` with a SMD of `r round(pwma.anhedonia$TE.random, 3)` (95% CI from `r round(pwma.anhedonia$lower.random, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anhedonia$upper.random, 3)`).
There is some heterogeneity as shown by the 95% prediction interval from `r round(pwma.anhedonia$lower.predict, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anhedonia$upper.predict, 3)`.

### 2.4.2 Risk of bias

![](data/human/LSR1RoBVisuals/robanhedonia1.png){width="65%"}

**Figure 3.** Risk of bias assessment.

Evidence for the efficacy of pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo were rated as having a range in their overall risk of bias.
Two studies (33%) were assessed as having 'high' risk of bias due to having 'high' risk of bias in the missing outcome data domain and selection of the reported results domain.
Two studies (33%) had an overall 'moderate' risk of bias rating as they had 'some concerns' in two domain ratings.
The remaining two studies were rated as having a 'low' overall risk of bias.

### 2.4.3 Reporting bias

The extent to which the result was affected by reporting biases was rated as low as per the RoB-ME assessment (Page et al. 2023).
This was as the potential for missing studies across the review was judged to be low.
In addition, none of the included studies were deemed to have generated an eligible result that was not reported, and no studies were judged to be unclear as to whether they generated an eligible result that was not reported.
We made this decision based on the results matrix we generated in step 2 of the RoB-ME tool (Page et al. 2023).

### 2.4.4 Meta-regression analyses

We did not perform any meta-regressions as the total number of studies was below 10.

### 2.4.5 Sensitivity analyses

We performed a series of random effects network meta-analyses on the MADRS "inability to feel" item (aggregated IPD from 34 studies, 14054 participants).
First, we included all the available studies and compared all the antidepressants against placebo.

#### 2.4.5.1 Aggregated IPD, all antidepressants and placebo, random effects network meta-analysis

![](result/human/non-dopaminergic/IPD_AD_NMA_pla_with_estimates.png)

**Figure 4.** Comparative effect sizes of antidepressants versus placebo.

The comparative effect of bupropion versus placebo was -0.12 (SMD, 95% CI from -0.25 to 0.00; 34 studies, 14054 participants), lower than what we could observe from the retrieved data (random effects pairwise meta-analysis, bupropion versus placebo): `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$TE.random, 2)` (SMD, 95% CI from `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$lower.random, 2)` to `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$upper.random, 2)`; `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$k.TE, 2)` `r ifelse(pwma.anhedonia.bup$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')`, `r pwma.anhedonia.bup$n.e.pooled+pwma.anhedonia.bup$n.c.pooled` participants).

```{r anhedonia_forest_bup, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}
forest(pwma.anhedonia.bup, 
       sortvar = seTE, 
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       label.e = 'Bupropion', 
       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours bupropion',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'Anhedonia symptoms severity',
       col.square = pwma.anhedonia.bup$data$colour,
       prediction = T
       )
```

**Figure 5.** Forest plot for symptoms of anhedonia (primary outcome) comparing bupropion versus placebo for individuals with anhedonia at 4-12 weeks (primary timepoint).
SMD: standardised mean difference, 95% CI: 95% confidence intervals, SD: standard deviation.

#### 2.4.5.2 Aggregated IPD, bupropion versus placebo, random effects pairwise meta-analysis

We also performed a random effects pairwise meta-analysis of bupropion versus placebo based on the aggregated IPD, resulting in estimates comparable to the network meta-analytical model (SMD -0.12, 95% CI from -0.29 to 0.05; 4 studies, 1085 participants).

#### 2.4.5.3 Aggregated IPD and early studies identified in this living systematic review, random effects pairwise meta-analysis

Finally, we performed a random effects pairwise meta-analysis including aggregate data from both sources (IPD and retrieved as aggregated).
As three studies (Hewett 2009 - 87997883, Hewett 2010a - 87997755, Koshino 2013 - 87997374) were available in both sources, we prioritised aggregate IPD over data retrieved as aggregated.
The comparative effect of bupropion versus placebo was -0.19 (SMD, 95% CI from -0.33 to 0.04; 6 studies, 2489 participants)

## 2.5 Secondary outcome: Reduction in mean anxiety score at 8 weeks (from 4 to 12 weeks)

### 2.5.1 Pairwise meta-analysis

```{r anxiety_forest, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8}
forest(pwma.anxiety, 
       sortvar = seTE, 
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       label.e = 'Intervention', 
       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'Anxiety symptoms severity',
       col.square = pwma.anxiety$data$colour,
       prediction = T
)
```

SMD: standardised mean difference, 95% CI: 95% confidence intervals, SD: standard deviation.

`r pwma.anxiety$k.TE` `r ifelse(pwma.anxiety$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')` contributed with data to the meta-analysis with a total of `r sum(c(pwma.anxiety$n.e.pooled, pwma.anxiety$n.c.pooled), na.rm = T)` participants (`r pwma.anxiety$n.e.pooled` allocated to pro-dopaminergic interventions, `r pwma.anxiety$n.c.pooled` allocated to pill placebo.

The comparative effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions versus placebo showed `r ifelse(((pwma.anxiety$lower.random < 0) & (pwma.anxiety$upper.random < 0)), 'an effect favouring pro-dopaminergic interventions', ifelse(((pwma.anxiety$lower.random > 0) & (pwma.anxiety$upper.random > 0)), 'an effect favouring placebo', 'a comparable effect not excluding the null effect'))` with a SMD of `r round(pwma.anxiety$TE.random, 3)` (95% CI from `r round(pwma.anxiety$lower.random, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anxiety$upper.random, 3)`).
The study results presented a 𝞽^2^ value of `r round(pwma.anxiety$tau2, 3)` indicating little to no heterogeneity (95% prediction interval: `r round(pwma.anxiety$lower.predict, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anxiety$upper.predict, 3)`).

### 2.5.3 Meta-regression analyses

The table below shows which of the covariates, if any, explain some of the heterogeneity (𝞽^2^) observed in the effect sizes of the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on anxiety symptom severity.
For anxiety baseline, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per point increase.
For age, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per year of age increase.
For female proportion, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per percentage point increase.
For treatment duration, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per week increase.
We did not perform a meta-regression on mean anhedonia baseline score as the total number of studies was below 10.

|     Moderator      |                    $\beta$                     |                                               95% CI                                               |                  𝞽^2^                  |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|
|   Overall effect   |      `r round(pwma.anxiety$TE.random, 3)`      |         `r round(pwma.anxiety$lower.random, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anxiety$upper.random, 3)`         |    `r round(pwma.anxiety$tau2, 2)`     |
|  Anxiety baseline  | `r round(reg.anxiety.anxiety[["beta"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.anxiety.anxiety[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.anxiety.anxiety[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.anxiety.anxiety$tau2, 2)` |
|        Age         |   `r round(reg.anxiety.age[["beta"]][2], 2)`   |     `r round(reg.anxiety.age[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.anxiety.age[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`     |   `r round(reg.anxiety.age$tau2, 2)`   |
| Female proportion  | `r round(reg.anxiety.female[["beta"]][2], 2)`  |  `r round(reg.anxiety.female[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.anxiety.female[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`  | `r round(reg.anxiety.female$tau2, 2)`  |
| Treatment duration |   `r round(reg.anxiety.tx[["beta"]][2], 2)`    |      `r round(reg.anxiety.tx[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.anxiety.tx[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`      |   `r round(reg.anxiety.tx$tau2, 2)`    |

The smaller 𝞽^2^ value for anxiety baseline suggests that this predictor seems to explain some of the heterogeneity.

## 2.6 Secondary outcome: Dropouts due to any reason

### 2.6.1 Pairwise meta-analysis

```

**Figure 8** Forest plot for dropouts due to any reason for the comparison of pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo at 4-12 weeks.
OR: odds ratio, 95% CI: 95% confidence intervals.

`r pwma.acc$k.TE` `r ifelse(pwma.acc$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')` contributed with data to the meta-analysis with a total of `r sum(c(pwma.acc$n.e., pwma.acc$n.c.), na.rm = T)` participants (`r sum(pwma.acc$n.e.)` allocated to pro-dopaminergic interventions, `r sum(pwma.acc$n.c.)` allocated to pill placebo).

The comparative effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions versus placebo showed `r ifelse(((exp(pwma.acc$lower.random) < 1) & (exp(pwma.acc$upper.random) < 1)), 'an effect favouring pro-dopaminergic interventions', ifelse(((exp(pwma.acc$lower.random) > 1) & (exp(pwma.acc$upper.random) > 1)), 'an effect favouring placebo', 'a comparable effect not excluding the null effect'))` with an OR of `r round(exp(pwma.acc$TE.random), 3)` (95% CI from `r round(exp(pwma.acc$lower.random), 3)` to `r round(exp(pwma.acc$upper.random), 3)`).
The study results presented a 𝞽^2^ value of `r round(pwma.acc$tau2, 3)`.
There is some heterogeneity as shown by the 95% prediction interval from `r round(exp(pwma.acc$lower.predict), 3)` to `r round(exp(pwma.acc$upper.predict), 3)`.

### 2.6.3 Meta-regression analyses

**Figure 9.** Risk of bias assessment.

The table below shows which of the covariates, if any, explain some of the heterogeneity (𝞽^2^) observed in the effect sizes of the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on acceptability.
For anxiety baseline, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per point increase.
For age, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per year of age increase.
For female proportion, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per percentage point increase.
For treatment duration, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per week increase.
We did not perform a meta-regression on mean anhedonia baseline score as the total number of studies was below 10.

|  Anxiety baseline  | `r round(reg.acc.anxiety[["beta"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.acc.anxiety[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.acc.anxiety[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.acc.anxiety$tau2, 2)` |
|        Age         |   `r round(reg.acc.age[["beta"]][2], 2)`   |     `r round(reg.acc.age[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.acc.age[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`     |   `r round(reg.acc.age$tau2, 2)`   |
| Female proportion  | `r round(reg.acc.female[["beta"]][2], 2)`  |  `r round(reg.acc.female[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.acc.female[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`  | `r round(reg.acc.female$tau2, 2)`  |
| Treatment duration |   `r round(reg.acc.tx[["beta"]][2], 2)`    |      `r round(reg.acc.tx[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.acc.tx[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`      |   `r round(reg.acc.tx$tau2, 2)`    |

The smaller 𝞽^2^ values for anxiety baseline and female proportion suggest that these predictors seem to explain some of the heterogeneity.

### 2.7.3 Meta-regression analyses

The table below shows which of the covariates, if any, explain some of the heterogeneity (𝞽^2^) observed in the effect sizes of the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on tolerability.
For anxiety baseline, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per point increase.
For age, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per year of age increase.
For female proportion, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per percentage point increase.
For treatment duration, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per week increase.
We did not perform a meta-regression on mean anhedonia baseline score as the total number of studies was below 10.

|  Anxiety baseline  | `r round(reg.tol.anxiety[["beta"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.tol.anxiety[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.tol.anxiety[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.tol.anxiety$tau2, 2)` |
|        Age         |   `r round(reg.tol.age[["beta"]][2], 2)`   |     `r round(reg.tol.age[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.tol.age[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`     |   `r round(reg.tol.age$tau2, 2)`   |
| Female proportion  | `r round(reg.tol.female[["beta"]][2], 2)`  |  `r round(reg.tol.female[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.tol.female[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`  | `r round(reg.tol.female$tau2, 2)`  |
| Treatment duration |   `r round(reg.tol.tx[["beta"]][2], 2)`    |      `r round(reg.tol.tx[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.tol.tx[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`      |   `r round(reg.tol.tx$tau2, 2)`    |

The tau\^2 value for the overall effect indicates that there is some between-study variability in the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on discontinuation due to side effects not explained by these moderators.The predictor anxiety baseline score explained minimal between-study variance and its 95% CI included zero.
While age and treatment duration both had tau\^2 scores that suggested moderate between study variance due to these predictors, their 95% CIs also included zero.
The predictor proportion of females had a negative beta and a 95% CI that did not include zero, indicating that in our model, for every 1% increase in proportion of females, there is a 5.9% (exp(2.82) = 0.059) decrease in the OR of discontinuation due to size effects.

### 2.12.3 Meta-regression analyses

The table below shows which of the covariates, if any, explain some of the heterogeneity (𝞽^2^) observed in the effect sizes of the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on dizziness.
For age, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per year of age.
For female proportion, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per percentage point increase.
For treatment duration, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per week.
We did not perform a meta-regression on mean anhedonia and anxiety baseline scores as the total number of studies was below 10.

|        Age         |  `r round(reg.dizziness.age[["beta"]][2], 2)`   |    `r round(reg.dizziness.age[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.dizziness.age[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`    |  `r round(reg.dizziness.age$tau2, 2)`   |
| Female proportion  | `r round(reg.dizziness.female[["beta"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.dizziness.female[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.dizziness.female[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)` | `r round(reg.dizziness.female$tau2, 2)` |
| Treatment duration |   `r round(reg.dizziness.tx[["beta"]][2], 2)`   |     `r round(reg.dizziness.tx[["ci.lb"]][2], 2)` to `r round(reg.dizziness.tx[["ci.ub"]][2], 2)`     |   `r round(reg.dizziness.tx$tau2, 2)`   |

The smaller 𝞽^2^ values for female proportion and treatment duration suggest that these predictors may explain some of the heterogeneity.

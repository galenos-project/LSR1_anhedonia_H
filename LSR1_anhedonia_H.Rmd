## 1. Methods (brief)

In this first iteration of the living systematic review we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared pro-dopaminergic interventions to placebo in adults with unipolar depression (i.e. any standardised measure, above-threshold symptoms on any standardised measure, or a clinical diagnosis based on any operationalised criteria).

Eight databases were searched from inception up to the 9th of November, 2023 (see [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies") for full search strings).
Database search results were imported into [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914 "EPPI-Reviewer") and de-duplicated prior to screening.
All steps related to record screening and data extraction were completed in [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914 "EPPI-Reviewer").

Titles and abstracts of the identified records were screened by at least two reviewers (CF, MC, JK, JP).
We retrieved the full-texts and any supporting documents for all records that were not excluded at the title and abstract screening stage.
The full-text screening was conducted by at least two reviewers (CF, JK, JP, AK, EB).
Conflicts at title and abstract, and full-text screening, were resolved through discussion between the two reviewers and involvement of a third reviewer (AC, EGO).
Additional information on the full study eligibility criteria can be found in the pre-published [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies").

Relevant data was extracted using [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914 "EPPI-Reviewer") by at least two reviewers (CF, CA, EB, JK).

As specified in our [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies"), we focused on:

-   anhedonia symptom severity: using anhedonia-specific scales, anhedonia-specific sub-scales, or individual items focusing on anhedonia (observer-rated or self-rated). Continuous, primary outcome.
-   acceptability: proportion of participants dropping out for any reason. Binary, secondary outcome.
-   tolerability: the proportion of participants dropping out due to an adverse event. Binary, secondary outcome.
-   safety: the proportion of participants reporting specific adverse events. Binary, secondary outcome.
-   anxiety symptom severity: as per observer or self-reported standardised scales. Continuous, secondary outcome.

For anhedonia and anxiety symptom severity, we extracted outcome data reported at 8 weeks post-treatment or manipulation.
If the information at 8 weeks was not available, we considered eligible data ranging between 4 and 12 weeks (with preference to the time point closest to 8 weeks and, if equidistant, the longer outcome).
For acceptability, tolerability, safety and safety (specific adverse events), we extracted outcome data reported at the end of the studies.

When extracting continuous outcomes we extracted mean and standard deviation to two decimal places.
Where standard error was reported instead, we converted the value to standard deviation.
Baseline and endpoint values were extracted, where only change in score and baseline or endpoint was reported, the missing value was calculated by adding or subtracting the change score to the baseline or endpoint.

When extracting dichotomous outcomes we extracted natural numbers and where only percentages of participant groups were reported, a value was calculated and rounded up to the nearest natural number.
Adverse events were extracted using the exact terms they were reported in the included studies.

We assessed risk of bias with the RoB2 tool (Higgins et al. 2019).
All outcomes for all included studies were assessed by at least two reviewers (JK, CF, CA, AH) and conflicts were resolved by discussion between reviewers (Flemyng et al. 2023).
To evaluate biases due to missing evidence and biases across studies, the ROB-ME tool (Page et al. 2023) was used with the same double screening and conflict resolution process as described above.

Effect sizes were calculated as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes (anhedonia and anxiety symptom severity) and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes (acceptability, tolerability, and specific-adverse events).
We calculated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the pooled effect size for each meta-analysis.

Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model with the inverse variance method, using the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for tau^2^ and the Q-Profile method for the confidence interval of tau^2^.
Confidence intervals were adjusted using the Hartung-Knapp method.
Prediction intervals were calculated to better report the effect of heterogeneity on the overall pooled effect.

We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses on the primary outcome.
We aggregated individual participant data (IPD) of randomised controlled trials on antidepressants in people with depression, performing a series of random effects network meta-analyses to compare the effects of pro-dopaminergic and non-pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions on anhedonia.

Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were also conducted for the following variables: mean age of participants, mean anhedonia baseline score, mean anxiety baseline score, sex (proportion of female participants), and planned treatment duration.
This was done using a mixed-effects model with the estimation of the between-study heterogeneity tau^2^ based on the REML method.
Meta-regressions were only conducted for outcomes where data was available from 10 or more studies.

Summary of evidence tables were constructed for all outcomes including a summary of the meta-analytic result, biases within-study, across-study, and due to indirectness.

Please refer to the [protocol](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-425 "Pro-dopaminergic pharmacological interventions for anhedonia in depression: protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies") and the extended data for more details.

## 2.3 Description of included studies

We identified `r length(unique(df$studlab))` eligible studies.
The study characteristics for studies that reported anhedonia scores can be found in **Table 1** and characteristics of studies that did not report anhedonia can be found in **Table 2**.
Data from `r cat(paste0(length(all.studies)))` studies contributed with at least one outcome with quantitative data (total of `r all.participants` participants), which included adults from multiple countries.
The mean age of participants was `r round(mean(df$age_mean, na.rm = T), 1)` years (range `r round(min(df$age_mean, na.rm = T), 0)` to `r round(max(df$age_mean, na.rm = T), 0)` years), with a mean proportion of `r round(mean(df$female_prop, na.rm = T), 2)` female participants (range `r round(min(df$female_prop, na.rm = T), 2)` to `r round(max(df$female_prop, na.rm = T), 2)`).
Included studies allocated the participants to treatment lasting between `r round(min(df$tx_duration, na.rm = T), 1)` to `r round(max(df$tx_duration, na.rm = T), 1)` weeks (median, `r round(median(df$tx_duration, na.rm = T), 1)` weeks).

## 2.4 Primary outcome: reduction in anhedonia scores at 8 weeks (from 4 to 12 weeks)

### 2.4.1 Pairwise meta-analysis

```{r anhedonia_forest, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
forest(pwma.anhedonia, 
       sortvar = seTE, 
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       label.e = 'Intervention', 
       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'Anhedonia symptoms severity',
       col.square = pwma.anhedonia$data$colour,
       prediction = T
       )
```

**Figure X** Forest plot for symptoms of anhedonia (primary outcome) comparing pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo for individuals with anhedonia at 4-12 weeks (primary timepoint).
SMD: standardised mean difference, 95%CI: 95% confidence intervals, SD: standard deviation.

`r pwma.anhedonia$k.TE` `r ifelse(pwma.anhedonia$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')` contributed with data to the meta-analysis with a total of `r sum(c(pwma.anhedonia$n.e.pooled, pwma.anhedonia$n.c.pooled), na.rm = T)` participants (`r pwma.anhedonia$n.e.pooled` allocated to pro-dopaminergic interventions, `r pwma.anhedonia$n.c.pooled` allocated to pill placebo).

The comparative effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions versus placebo showed `r ifelse(((pwma.anhedonia$lower.random < 0) & (pwma.anhedonia$upper.random < 0)), 'an effect favouring pro-dopaminergic interventions', ifelse(((pwma.anhedonia$lower.random > 0) & (pwma.anhedonia$upper.random > 0)), 'an effect favouring placebo', 'a comparable effect not excluding the null effect'))` with a SMD of `r round(pwma.anhedonia$TE.random, 3)` (95%CI from `r round(pwma.anhedonia$lower.random, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anhedonia$upper.random, 3)`).
The study results presented a tau^2^ value of `r round(pwma.anhedonia$tau2, 3)` (accounting for a 95% prediction interval from `r round(pwma.anhedonia$lower.predict, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anhedonia$upper.predict, 3)`).

### 2.4.2 Risk of bias

![](data\human\LSR1RoBVisuals\robanhedonia1.png)

![](data\human\LSR1RoBVisuals\robanhedonia2.png)

Evidence for the efficacy of pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo in improving anhedonia was rated moderate for risk of bias.
50% of the included studies had an overall high risk of bias while the other 50% had moderate risk of bias, primarily due to missing outcome data, issues with outcome measurement, and selective reporting of findings.
The extent to which the result was affected by across-study biases is unclear and all included studies were rated at least moderate in domain 5, selection of results.
This result was judged to be at moderate risk of bias due to indirectness as while there was no clear indication of indirectness in terms of population, comparator, or outcomes, 80% of the studies measured the same intervention, bupropion.

### 2.4.3 Reporting bias
We evaluated the reporting bias using the ROB-ME tool (Page et al. 2023), taking into account the usable data from the eligible studies identified in the search, the comprehensiveness of the search, small-study effects, and potential patterns of missingness. We followed the algorithm to assign a low or high risk of reporting bias, or to express some concerns, by answering signalling questions related to the domains mentioned above.

#### 2.4.3.1 Results matrix


#### 2.4.3.2 Funnel plot and examination of small-study effects


#### 2.4.3.3 Coverage of the search strategy


#### 2.4.3.4 ROB-ME evaluation


#### 2.4.4 Sub-group and meta-regression analyses

We did not perform a meta-regression as the total number of studies was below 10.

### 2.4.5 Sensitivity analyses

We performed a series of random effects network meta-analyses on the MADRS "inability to feel" item (aggregated IPD from 34 studies, 14054 participants).
First, we included all the available studies and compared all the antidepressants against placebo.

![](result/human/non-dopaminergic/IPD_AD_NMA_pla_with_estimates.png)

The comparative effect of bupropion versus placebo was -0.12 (SMD, 95%CI from -0.25 to 0.00; 34 studies, 14054 participants), lower than what we could observe from the retrieved data (random effects pairwise meta-analysis, bupropion versus placebo): `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$TE.random, 2)` (SMD, 95%CI from `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$lower.random, 2)` to `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$upper.random, 2)`; `r round(pwma.anhedonia.bup$k.TE, 2)` `r ifelse(pwma.anhedonia.bup$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')`, `r pwma.anhedonia.bup$n.e.pooled+pwma.anhedonia.bup$n.c.pooled` participants).

```{r anhedonia_forest_bup, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
forest(pwma.anhedonia.bup, 
       sortvar = seTE, 
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       label.e = 'Bupropion', 
       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours bupropion',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'Anhedonia symptoms severity',
       col.square = pwma.anhedonia.bup$data$colour,
       prediction = T
       )
```

We also performed a random effects pairwise meta-analysis of bupropion versus placebo based on the aggregated IPD, resulting in estimates comparable to the network meta-analytical model (SMD -0.12, 95%CI from -0.29 to 0.05; 4 studies, 1085 participants).

Finally, we performed a random effects pairwise meta-analysis including aggregate data from both sources (IPD and retrieved as aggregated).
As three studies (Hewett 2009 - 87997883, Hewett 2010a - 87997755, Koshino 2013 - 87997374) were available in both sources, we prioritised aggregate IPD over data retrieved as aggregated.
The comparative effect of bupropion versus placebo was -0.19 (SMD, 95%CI from -0.33 to 0.04; 6 studies, 2489 participants)

       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'Anxiety symptoms severity',
       col.square = pwma.anxiety$data$colour,
       prediction = T
)
```

**Figure X** Forest plot for symptoms of anxiety (secondary outcome) comparing pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo for individuals with anxiety at 4-12 weeks (primary timepoint).

`r pwma.anxiety$k.TE` `r ifelse(pwma.anxiety$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')` contributed with data to the meta-analysis with a total of `r sum(c(pwma.anxiety$n.e.pooled, pwma.anxiety$n.c.pooled), na.rm = T)` participants (`r pwma.anxiety$n.e.pooled` allocated to pro-dopaminergic interventions, `r pwma.anxiety$n.c.pooled` allocated to pill placebo.

The comparative effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions versus placebo showed `r ifelse(((pwma.anxiety$lower.random < 0) & (pwma.anxiety$upper.random < 0)), 'an effect favouring pro-dopaminergic interventions', ifelse(((pwma.anxiety$lower.random > 0) & (pwma.anxiety$upper.random > 0)), 'an effect favouring placebo', 'a comparable effect not excluding the null effect'))` with a SMD of `r round(pwma.anxiety$TE.random, 3)` (95%CI from `r round(pwma.anxiety$lower.random, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anxiety$upper.random, 3)`).
The study results presented a tau^2^ value of `r round(pwma.anxiety$tau2, 3)` (accounting for a 95% prediction interval from `r round(pwma.anxiety$lower.predict, 3)` to `r round(pwma.anxiety$upper.predict, 3)`).

### 2.5.3 Sub-group and meta-regression analyses

The table below shows which of the covariates, if any, explain some of the heterogeneity observed in the effect sizes of the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on anhedonia symptom severity. We present marginal R~\*~^2^ based on effect sizes, which measures the proportion of variance explained by including moderators in the model (the % change in the between-studies variance when the covariate is included in the model, in other words the % of the heterogeneity explained by the variable). For anxiety baseline, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per point increase. For age, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per year of age.

### 2.8.3 Sub-group and meta-regression analyses

The table below shows which of the covariates, if any, explain some of the heterogeneity observed in the effect sizes of the effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions on anhedonia symptom severity. We present marginal R~\*~^2^ based on effect sizes, which measures the proportion of variance explained by including moderators in the model (the % change in the between-studies variance when the covariate is included in the model, in other words the % of the heterogeneity explained by the variable). For age, the regression coefficient ($\beta$) is intended per year of age.

## 2.14 Secondary outcome: vomiting

### 2.14.1 Pairwise meta-analysis

```{r vomiting_forest, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
forest(pwma.vomiting, 
       sortvar = seTE, 
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       label.e = 'Intervention', 
       label.c = 'Placebo', 
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours placebo",
       smlab = 'vomiting',
       col.square = pwma.vomiting$data$colour,
       prediction = T
)
```

**Figure X** Forest plot for vomiting for the comparison of pro-dopaminergic interventions vs placebo at 4-12 weeks.
OR: odds ratio, 95%CI: 95% confidence intervals.

`r pwma.vomiting$k.TE` `r ifelse(pwma.vomiting$k.TE>1, 'studies', 'study')` contributed with data to the meta-analysis with a total of `r sum(c(pwma.vomiting$n.e., pwma.vomiting$n.c.), na.rm = T)` participants (`r sum(pwma.vomiting$n.e.)` allocated to pro-dopaminergic interventions, `r sum(pwma.vomiting$n.c.)` allocated to pill placebo).

The comparative effect of pro-dopaminergic interventions versus placebo showed `r ifelse(((exp(pwma.vomiting$lower.random) < 1) & (exp(pwma.vomiting$upper.random) < 1)), 'an effect favouring pro-dopaminergic interventions', ifelse(((exp(pwma.vomiting$lower.random) > 1) & (exp(pwma.vomiting$upper.random) > 1)), 'an effect favouring placebo', 'a comparable effect not excluding the null effect'))` with an OR of `r round(exp(pwma.vomiting$TE.random), 3)` (95%CI from `r round(exp(pwma.vomiting$lower.random), 3)` to `r round(exp(pwma.vomiting$upper.random), 3)`).
The study results presented a tau^2^ value of `r round(pwma.vomiting$tau2, 3)` (accounting for a 95% prediction interval from `r round(exp(pwma.vomiting$lower.predict), 3)` to `r round(exp(pwma.vomiting$upper.predict), 3)`).
